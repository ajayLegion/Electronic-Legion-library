# Electronic-Legion-library
Minimal, student-friendly electronic schematic symbols and component definitions. Designed for AI-assisted diagram generation and simple educational circuits. 
A structured repository for analog electronics concepts, circuit theory, schematic symbols, component metadata, and simulation files.
## Repository Sections

### 1. Circuits
Topic-based folders containing explanations and diagrams:
- OP-AMP circuits
- Filters
- Diode circuits
- Transistor circuits
- Basic circuit theory

### 2. Simulations
Simulation-ready files:
- LTspice (.asc)
- Proteus project files

### 3. Symbols
A minimal library of SVG schematic symbols organized by category:
- Resistors, capacitors, inductors  
- Diodes and other semiconductors  
- BJTs, MOSFETs  
- OPAMP blocks  
- Miscellaneous symbols  

These symbols are designed for easy reuse in notes, docs, and auto-generated diagrams.

### 4. Components (YAML)
Machine-readable component definitions:
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Inductors
- Semiconductors (diodes, BJT, MOSFET)
- Power components
- ICs

Each file follows the validation schema in `/schemas`.

### 5. Schemas
Validation structures for consistent component definitions:
- Component schema
- Symbol schema
- Metadata schema

### 6. Examples
Sample diagrams, component lists, and notes showing how everything works together.

## Purpose
To build a long-term, organized analog electronics reference that includes:
- Human-readable notes  
- Machine-readable components  
- Reusable schematic symbols  
- Verified circuit examples
